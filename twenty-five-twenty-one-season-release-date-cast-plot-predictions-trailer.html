So far, the series has a rating of 8.9/010 on IMDB, an indication that it is doing good enough, but this could either shoot up or go down as the audience keeps watching the series.</p><p>Filming of the first season started on September 7th, 2021, and five months later, the <a href=#>series debuted on Netflix</a>. If the series gets a renewal for the second installment, we expect it to follow the same schedule as season one did. Renewal within the year may mean that the series will premiere in mid 2024.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Twenty-Five Twenty-One star Kim Tae-ri Apologized for Sad Ending:</h2><p>Kim Tae-Ri expressed regret about the ending in an interview after the finale aired earlier this month, as reported by Soompi. “While watching the drama, I thought Hee-do was adorable and Baek Yi-jin was a wonderful and loving person. Hee-do was in the same boat. Isn’t it viewer’s&nbsp;wish that their mutually supporting relationship lasts till the end? And what about before marriage, if marriage is the end? I would have supported their happy ending if I hadn’t been the performer. I’m sorry because we had such a large audience. “I’m also sad.”</p><p>She also expressed dissatisfaction with the conclusion. “I was heartbroken.” My first love wasn’t like Hee-do and Yi- jin’s. Their first love was so fantastic. Don’t they seem to have everything a first love could have? I was very saddened when I had to break up with that kind of first love.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=twenty-five-twenty-one-season-2-plot-what-could-it-be-about>Twenty-Five Twenty-One Season&nbsp;2 Plot: What could it be about?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/twenty-five-twenty-one-plot.jpg><p>Told in two different timelines, the <a href=#>korean drama</a> revolves around two imperfect and different people whose lives cross, just like it was written in destiny. Baek Yi-jin is a hardworking young man trying to rebuild his life after a crisis, while Na Hee-do is a whiz kid fencer whose fencing dream almost deems when she loses her fencing team.</p><p>Despite the setbacks the two have been through, they decide to take a different approach to life and build something out of it than wallowing in sorrow. In the present day, however, Na Hee-do’s daughter Kim Min Chae quits ballet and seeks refuge in her grandmother’s <a href=#>house</a>. She chances upon her mother’s diary, and the stories in 1998 are told through her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=twenty-five-twenty-one-season-2-cast-who-will-appear>Twenty-Five Twenty-One Season&nbsp;2 Cast: Who will appear?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/besttoppers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/twenty-five-twenty-one-cast.jpg><p>We expect most casts to reprise their roles once the series gets the green light for the second installment, which is yet to be ascertained. Kim So-Hyun (<a href=#>Love Alarm</a>) will be back as Na Hee-do (adult version), Ko Ye-rin as Na Hee-do (young version), the fencing prodigy who is yet to reach her goal. Nam Joo-hyuk (<a href=#>The School Nurse Files</a>) casts as Baek Yi-jin, Bona as Go Yoo-rim (the gold medalist also Hee-do’s greatest idol and rival), Choi Hyun, and Lee Joo-Myung as Ji Seung-wan, Joan of Arc class leader.
