Antics at Playboy Mansion</h1><div id=sub-header>January 2024 · 4 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p>She’s a wide open book. <strong>Holly Madison </strong>spoke to<strong> Us Weekly Video</strong> exclusively about what exactly went on inside <strong>Hugh Hefner</strong>‘s bedroom at the Playboy Mansion back when she was one of his chosen girlfriends.</p><p>Madison’s <a href=# rel=noopener>shocking new tell-all memoir</a>, Down the Rabbit Hole: Curious Adventures and Cautionary Tales of a Former Playboy Bunny, details the years of verbal abuse she allegedly endured while living with the Playboy founder in his legendary mansion.</p><p>“When I first started going to parties at the mansion, it was very glamorous,” Madison told Us’ <strong>Ingrid Meilan </strong>last month at her L.A. home. “I was still in college and very starstruck. I am happy to be able to finally set the record straight.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Holly-Madison-Details-Hugh-Hefners-Bedroom-Antics-Inside-Playboy-Mansion-It-Was-a-Miserable-Part-of-My-Life-Holly-Madison.jpg><p>Madison, now 35, first met Hefner at L.A.’s Las Palmas nightclub in August 2001, when she was 21 years old. The Astoria, Oregon, native (population 9,477), was a struggling actress at the time Hefner propositioned her, and offered her drugs. In her memoir, Madison wrote that she wanted to “scream ‘PAUSE!’ and freeze-frame that moment of my life.”</p><p>After all, Madison went home with Hefner — and his other women. “This book is a chance for me to finally tell people how things really were in my life,” she explained. Madison added in her memoir: “I want to grab that young girl, shake her back into reality and scream, ‘What the hell are you thinking?'”</p><p>While speaking with<strong> Us</strong>, Madison detailed what exactly happened that fateful evening inside Hef’s bedroom. “The first night I had spent at the Playboy Mansion was definitely very eye-opening,” she shared. “It was clear that there was certain things expected of you. It was clear that there was a definite routine going on, and it was very bizarre. It definitely wasn’t what I expected it to be, it was a lot scarier. I was offered prescription drugs.”</p><p>“I don’t know what people think goes on in the bedroom,” she continued in her conversation with <strong>Us</strong>, “but it was always very much the same, and intimidating, and not something that I liked. It was a miserable part of my life.”</p><p>In her memoir <a href=# rel=noopener>excerpted by <strong>Us</strong></a> in the June 22 issue, Madison shared that the girls first dipped their feet into a black bathtub before slipping into pink flannel pajamas. “Two huge television screens projecting graphic porn lit up the otherwise dark bed. In the middle, a very pale man was tending to his own business (if you’re catching my thinly veiled innuendo) and puffing on a joint before passing it around to the nearest blonde. The girlfriends, in various stages of undress, were sitting in a semicircle at the edge of the bed — some kneeling, some standing, some lying down.”</p><p>Several weeks after that night, Madison moved in, and for years, competed with her fellow Playmates for Hefner’s affection. “There was a lot of politics inside the mansion,” Madison told <strong>Us</strong>. “Very catty, very competitive, a kind of scary place to live.”</p><p>Then, she discovered that Hef was the enemy. “He just encouraged it because it made him feel special,” she told <strong>Us</strong>. “Looking back, I see that he was the orchestrator of the whole thing.”</p><p>Madison further elaborated to<strong> Us</strong> the alleged verbal abuse and criticism she endured as one of Hef’s live-in girlfriends. The star (now married to <strong>Pasquale Rotella,</strong> with whom she shares 2-year-old daughter <strong>Rainbow</strong>) said her saving grace was E!’s reality series The Girls Next Door, which also featured <strong>Bridget Marquardt </strong>and<strong> Kendra Wilkinson</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While Madison’s made these claims, Hefner <a href=# rel=noopener>released an exclusive statement to <strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> on Sunday, June 21, about his former flame’s allegations.</p><p>“Over the course of my life I’ve had more than my fair share of romantic relationships with wonderful women,” the Playboy founder told <strong>Us</strong>. “Many moved on to live happy, healthy, and productive lives, and I’m pleased to say remain dear friends today. Sadly, there are a few who have chosen to rewrite history in an attempt to stay in the spotlight. I guess, as the old saying goes: You can’t win ’em all!”</p><p>Watch <strong>Us Weekly</strong>‘s exclusive video with Madison above for more details on life inside the Playboy Mansion, and pick up a copy of her memoir, Down the Rabbit Hole: Curious Adventures and Cautionary Tales of a Former Playboy Bunny, out Tuesday, June 23.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJ%2BopJyueq6tw6KqqKZdmbK1rcilqmagpZy1brTEn6WeqqNir6aw0aimpmWRo8Gqr9JmmK1loKGuuq7OsmSmmZ6otrC6jGtnam1iaIM%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./indiana-woman-allegedly-tracks-boyfriend-using-apple-airtags-accuses-him-of-cheating-murders-him-reports-crime-online.html>&#171;&nbsp;Indiana Woman Allegedly Tracks Boyfriend Using Apple Airtags, Accuses Him of Cheating &amp;amp; Murders Him:</a>
