The officer, whose name was not immediately released, was in stable condition at a hospital Wednesday and two men were arrested.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mora was the youngest of four children in a tight-knit family that emigrated from the Dominican Republic and eventually settled in East Harlem. He is survived by his older sister, Karina Mora, and two brothers, Wilson and Jonathan.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘He was a gentle giant,’ Rashad Mujumder, Mora’s high school friend, told PIX11. Mujumder said that standing at 6 feet, 3 inches tall, Mora was ‘the biggest person in the room with the softest heart.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mujumder said Mora’s father supported his family as a barber and his mother, Amalia, worked in health care.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘His parents are very proud of him,’ the friend said. ‘Seeing him put on the uniform was an amazing moment for them.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Mora, 27, joined the New York Police Department in October 2018, after graduating from John Jay College of Criminal Justice. According to one of his professors, Irina Zakirova, Mora was interested in improving relations between police and the neighborhoods they patrolled.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘He was so certain about becoming a police officer – a good police officer,’ Zakirova said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That sensibility endured in his police work. Stephanie McGraw, a domestic violence victims’ advocate who got to know Mora while visiting his stationhouse, said last week that he ‘understood the importance of getting into this very crucial and important role as a police officer – to not only make a difference but to bring some more men and women of color into the NYPD.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At the same time, Mora made 33 arrests during his few years on the job. Fellow officers recalled him as a humble, helpful colleague who took the bus to work.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Retired NYPD detective-turned-Fox News contributor&nbsp; Angel Maysonet paid tribute to Mora on Instagram, sharing a series of photos of the officer spending time with friends.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He wrote in a post accompanying the images: ‘Everyone says he was a big teddy bear. Kind. A fun “goofball.” Life of the party. Always smiling. Took care of his elderly parents who are lost & devastated without him. Young Dominican son of NYC. The epitome of what you want as an NYPD cop.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Everyone says he was a big teddy bear. Kind. Life of the party.
