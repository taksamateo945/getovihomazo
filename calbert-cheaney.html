Calbert Nathaniel Cheaney, born July 17, 1971, is an American basketball coach. He is also a former player and is currently an assistant coach for College Park Skyhawks in the NBA G League.&nbsp;From 1989 to 1993, he was a star player for the Indiana Hoosiers under Bob Knight.&nbsp;Cheaney was a three-time All-American at the end of his career and is still the Big Ten’s leading scorer with 2,613 points in his career.&nbsp;He helped Indiana achieve a record of 105-27 and the NCAA Tournament in all four years, including a Final Four appearance.</p><p>Cheaney, a junior in the 1991-92 season felt that he was struggling from the fatigue resulting from the intense summer play.&nbsp;Cheaney was able to “not have to score as many” because of the talents of players such as Alan Henderson.&nbsp;His three-point shooting percentage fell significantly and he regressed back to 17.6 points per games.&nbsp;The Hoosiers ended the regular season with a record of 27-7 overall and 14-4 in conference. They finished 2nd in Big Ten Conference.&nbsp;The 1992 NCAA Tournament was an invitation to the Hoosiers as a 2-seed. They advanced to the Final Four but lost to Duke in a game in Minneapolis.</p><p>Cheaney was selected 6th overall by the Washington Bullets in the 1993 NBA draft. His strongest showing as pro came in 1994–1995 when he averaged a career-high 16.6 points for Washington. He spent six years playing for the Bullets/Wizards (including a playoff appearance in 1997). He would go on to play for the Boston Celtics, Denver Nuggets, and Utah Jazz, before closing his career out with three years with the Golden State Warriors, retiring after the 2005–06 season. During his thirteen-year NBA career, Cheaney played for five different teams, averaging 9.5 points and 3.2 rebounds.</p><p>Cheaney appeared along with many of his 1997 Bullet teammates (Juwan Howard, Ben Wallace, and Ashraf Amaya) in singer Crystal Waters’ 1996 video “Say If You Feel Alright”. He also appeared in the 1994 film Blue Chips as a player for the Indiana University Hoosiers.</p><p align=justify>As a sophomore, Cheaney averaged 21.6 point per game.
